This repository hosts an app designed to assist legal professionals and individuals in criminal cases by enabling the upload of all case-specific legal documents—such as case notes, sentencing remarks, court judgments, and more. The app leverages AI to analyze these documents, identify grounds of merit for an appeal, compare similar cases, and assess the likelihood of success based on severity and precedence. It generates comprehensive investigative legal reports and suggests recommended actions. Additionally, it highlights relevant legislative frameworks, sections of legislation violated, and comparative sentencing benchmarks. Please note: this app does not facilitate appeal submission or tracking; it is purely a resource for case preparation.
